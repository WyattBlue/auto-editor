## A Note about Formating
The $ symbol that you in commands should not actually be included when you type a command in or copy-paste it to your command-line. Their purpose is to:
 1. Signify that this command should be run on a command-line.
 2. Signify that this command is a complete version that you can run, unlike fragments that are meant to demonstrate the usage of a specific argument.

## Minimal Example
Create an edited version of example.mp4 with the default parameters.
```console
 $ python auto-editor.py example.mp4
```

## Changing Video Speed
Video speed will change speed of the output's video and audio. For instance, if the speed is set to 2. Half of the frames will be dropped and the audio will be speed up with phasevocoder. This does not affect parts of the that are below the silent threshold.
```
 $ python auto-editor.py example.mp4 --video_speed 2
```

Default 1
Range 0 to 99999

Alternatively, you can use the short versions:

```console
 $ python auto-editor.py example.mp4 -v 1.8 -s 8
```

## Zooming In
You can tell auto-editor to zoom in when the input's audio is above the loudness threshold. Auto-Editor will hold the zoom until there's a cut.

```console
--loudness_threshold
```

Default 2 This effectively disables zoom
Range 0 to 1

Here is a side by side comparison between a video with no zoom, and a video with auto zoom.
