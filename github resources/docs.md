## A Note about Formating
The $ symbol that you in commands should not actually be included when you type a command in or copy-paste it to your command-line. Their purpose is to:
 1. Signify that this command should be run on a command-line.
 2. Signify that this command is a complete version that you can run, unlike fragments that are meant to demonstrate a specific argument.

## Minimal Example
Create an edited version of example.mp4 with the default parameters.
```terminal
 $ python auto-editor.py example.mp4
```

## Changing the Feel
###### a.k.a. Changing the padding
You can change how much space (frames) their is between each cut by specifing the frame margin. The frame margin is how much frames there are on each side between the loud parts.

```terminal
 $ python auto-editor.py example.mp4 --frame_margin 1
```

Command | `--frame_margin`
--------|--------------
type    | int
range   | 0 to Infinity
default | 4
shorts  | `-m`


## Changing Video Speed
Video speed will change speed of the output's video and audio. For instance, if the speed is set to 2. Half of the frames will be dropped and the audio will be speed up with phasevocoder. This does not affect parts of the that are below the silent threshold.
```
 $ python auto-editor.py example.mp4 --video_speed 2
```

Command | `--video_speed`
--------|--------------
type    | float
range   | 0 to 99999
default | 1
shorts  | `-v`
alias   | `--sounded_speed`

You can also do the same, but for the silent parts with --silent_speed
```
 $ python auto-editor.py example.mp4 --video_speed 2 --silent_speed 8
```


Command | `--silent_speed`
--------|--------------
type    | float
range   | 0 to 99999
default | 99999
shorts  | `-s`


## Zooming In
You can tell auto-editor to zoom in when the input's audio is above the loudness threshold. Auto-Editor will hold the zoom until there's a cut.

```terminal
--loudness_threshold
```

Command | `--loudness_threshold`
--------|---------------------
type    | float
range   | 0 to 1
default | 2
shorts  | `-l`


Here is a side by side comparison between a video with no zoom, and a video with auto zoom.

## Inputing Files
```
auto-editor.py input
```

Input is the only required argument in auto-editor. It supports video formats, audio formats, and URLs.

## Adding Music
You can add background music to your video automatically.

```terminal
 $ python auto-editor.py example.mp4 --background_music example_media/Magic_in_the_Garden.mp3
```

It will be quiet than the video's audio by 10dB and will fade out at the last second of the video.

## Adding Commentary
You can add an audio track to your video that will replace the video's audio as the one to base cuts on.

```terminal
 $ python auto-editor.py example.mp4 --cut_by_this_track example_media/newCommentary.mp3
```

This option is good for combining gameplay videos with commentary, but beware that it doesn't change the volume for either audio unlike `--background_music`.


## Miscellaneous

```terminal
 $ python auto-editor.py --help
```

Get the version of auto-editor you're using.
