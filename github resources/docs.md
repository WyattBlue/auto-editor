# Documentation
## Minimal Example

Create an edited version of example.mp4 with the default parameters.
```console
python auto-editor.py example.mp4
```

## Changing Video Speed

Video speed will change speed of the output's video and audio. For instance, if the speed is set to 2. Half of the frames will be dropped and the audio will be speed up with phasevocoder. This does not affect parts of the that are below the silent thershold.
```console
 --video_speed
```

Default 1
Range 0 to 99999

Alternatively, you can use the short versions:

```console
$ python auto-editor.py example.mp4 -v 1.8 -s 8
```

## Zooming In
You can tell auto-editor to zoom in when the input's audio is above the loudness threshold. Auto-Editor will hold the zoom until there's a cut.

```console
--loudness_threshold
```

Default 2 This effectively disables zoom
Range 0 to 1
Output:

<p align="center">
  <img src="/github%20resources/auto_zoom_demo.gif" width="800">
</p>

## Using Audio File Types

You can use audio formats (.wav, .mp3) instead of just video formats and auto-editor will output an altered version.

```console
auto-editor.py example.wav
```

## Download Video from a Website

Thanks to youtube-dl, you can enter in URL's as your input source instead of local files.

```console
auto-editor.py "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcs82HnguGc"
```
