# Auto-Editor
Auto-Editor is a command line application program for automatically editing **video or audio**.
It works by analyzing the video's audio to detect when a section needs to be cut or kept in, then it runs a subprocess called ffmpeg to create the new video.

## New in 20w27b!
 * You now edit the cuts Auto-Editor does with Adobe Premiere Pro using the `--export_to_premiere` flag. It will make an XML file that you can import to Premiere.
 * fastVideoPlus.py is no longer so RAM intensive.
 * preview.py now uses tempfile.
 * The SciPy the module is no longer needed.
 * Other small improvements have been made.

## Usage
### Minimal Example

Create an edited version of example.mp4 with the default parameters.
```terminal
 $ python auto-editor.py example.mp4
```

### Change the Feel
You can change the **pace** of a video by changing by including frames that are silent but are next to loud parts. A frame margin of 8 will add up to 8 frames before and 8 frames after the loud part.

```terminal
 $ python auto-editor.py example.mp4 --frame_margin 8
```

There are many more features in auto-editor, including **adding in background music** that automatically gets quieter, and **zooming in** the video when it gets especially loud.

[See the docs](/resources/docs.md) for more commands and usages.
