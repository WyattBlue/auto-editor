# Auto-Editor
Auto-Editor is a video editing tool that can automatically edit raw source video into a entertaining and polished video.
It works by analyzing the video's audio to detect when a section needs to be cut, kept in, or zoomed in, then auto-editor runs a subprocess called ffmpeg to create the new video.

## New in 20w22c!
You can now change which audio track to base the cuts on by adding an audio track to the `cut_by_this_track` option.

```terminal
 $ python auto-editor.py videoWith2Tracks.mp4 --cut_by_this_track 1
```

The old functionally of `cut_by_this_track` has been moved to `cut_by_this_audio`
```terminal
 $ python auto-editor.py example.mp4 --cut_by_this_audio example_media/newCommentary.mp3
```

You can also combine all tracks like they were in one before cutting.

```terminal
 $ python auto-editor.py videoWith2Tracks.mp4 --cut_by_all_tracks
```

# Usage
## Minimal Example

Create an edited version of example.mp4 with the default parameters.
```terminal
 $ python auto-editor.py example.mp4
```

## Change the Feel
You can change feel of the video by changing how much frames

```terminal
 $ python auto-editor.py example.mp4 --frame_margin 8 --silent_threshold 0.03
```
