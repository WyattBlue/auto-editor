**Auto-Editor** is a command line application for automatically **editing video and audio** by analyzing a variety of methods, most notably audio loudness.

Before doing the real editing, you first cut out the "dead space" which is typically silence. This is known as a "first pass". Cutting these is a boring task, especially if the video is very long.

```
auto-editor path/to/your/video.mp4
```

<h2 align="center">Installing</h2>

```
pip install auto-editor
```

See [Installing](https://auto-editor.com/installing) for additional information.


<h2 align="center">Cutting</h2>

Change the **pace** of the edited video by using `--margin`.

`--margin` adds in some "silent" sections to make the editing feel nicer.

```
# Add 0.2 seconds of padding before and after to make the edit nicer.
# `0.2s` is the default value for `--margin`
auto-editor example.mp4 --margin 0.2sec

# Add 0.3 seconds of padding before, 1.5 seconds after
auto-editor example.mp4 --margin 0.3s,1.5sec
```

### Methods for Making Automatic Cuts
The `--edit` option is how auto-editor makes automated cuts.

For example, edit out motionlessness in a video by setting `--edit motion`.

```
# cut out sections where the total motion is less than 2%.
auto-editor example.mp4 --edit motion:threshold=0.02

# `--edit audio:threshold=0.04,stream=all` is used by defaut.
auto-editor example.mp4

# Different tracks can be set with different attribute.
auto-editor multi-track.mov --edit "(or audio:stream=0 audio:threshold=10%,stream=1)"
```

Different editing methods can be used together.
```
# 'threshold' is always the first argument for edit-method objects
auto-editor example.mp4 --edit "(or audio:0.03 motion:0.06)"
```

You can also use `dB` unit, a volume unit familiar to video-editors (case sensitive):
```
auto-editor example.mp4 --edit audio:-19dB
auto-editor example.mp4 --edit audio:-7dB
auto-editor example.mp4 --edit motion:-19dB
```

### See What Auto-Editor Cuts Out
To export what auto-editor normally cuts out. Set `--video-speed` to `99999` and `--silent-speed` to `1`. This is the reverse of the usual default values.  

```
auto-editor example.mp4 --video-speed 99999 --silent-speed 1
```

<h2 align="center">Exporting to Editors</h2>

Create an XML file that can be imported to Adobe Premiere Pro using this command:

```
auto-editor example.mp4 --export premiere
```

Auto-Editor can also export to:
- DaVinci Resolve with `--export resolve`
- Final Cut Pro with `--export final-cut-pro`
- ShotCut with `--export shotcut`
- Individual media clips with `--export clip-sequence`

### Naming Timelines
Some editors support naming timelines. By default, auto-editor will use the name "Auto-Editor Media Group". For `premiere` `resolve` and `final-cut-pro` export options, you can change the name with the following syntax.

```
# for POSIX shells
auto-editor example.mp4 --export 'premiere:name="Your name here"'

# for Powershell
auto-editor example.mp4 --export 'premiere:name=""Your name here""'
```

### Split by Clip

If you want to split the clips, but don't want auto-editor to do any more editing. There's a simple command.
```
auto-editor example.mp4 --silent-speed 1 --video-speed 1 --export premiere
```

<h2 align="center">Manual Editing</h2>

Use the `--cut-out` option to always remove a section.

```
# Cut out the first 30 seconds.
auto-editor example.mp4 --cut-out 0,30sec

# Cut out the first 30 frames.
auto-editor example.mp4 --cut-out 0,30

# Always leave in the first 30 seconds.
auto-editor example.mp4 --add-in 0,30sec

# Cut out the last 10 seconds.
auto-editor example.mp4 --cut-out -10sec,end

# You can do multiple at once.
auto-editor example.mp4 --cut-out 0,10 15sec,20sec
auto-editor example.mp4 --add-in 30sec,40sec 120,150sec
```

And of course, you can use any `--edit` configuration.

If you don't want **any automatic cuts**, you can use `--edit none` or `--edit all/e`

```
# Cut out the first 5 seconds, leave the rest untouched.
auto-editor example.mp4 --edit none --cut-out 0,5sec

# Leave in the first 5 seconds, cut everything else out.
auto-editor example.mp4 --edit all/e --add-in 0,5sec
```

Use `--help` with a specific option to learn more about it:

```
auto-editor -c:v --help
