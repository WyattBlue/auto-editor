**Auto-Editor** is a command line application for automatically **editing video and audio** by removing the silent parts.

## New in 20w31a
 * Calculating chunks is now done in \_\_main\_\_.py so all cutting commands like `--combine_all_tracks` work automatically for all existing and feature methods.
 * Calculating chunks is now changed so that it is better.
 * Added two new commands `--min_clip_length`, `--min_cut_length`. They change how cutting works so, for instance, that one volume spike gets ignored.
 * Added short `-ca` for `--cut_by_this_audio`.
 * Added short `-cat` for `--cut_by_all_tracks`.
 * The scripts folder has been renamed to auto_editor.
 * requirements.txt has been removed.
 * Renamed originalMethod.py to advancedVideo.py. Similarly, originalVid.py has been renamed to splitVid.py

[See the Changelog](https://github.com/WyattBlue/auto-editor/blob/master/resources/CHANGELOG.md) for all the differences between releases.

## Usage
Create an edited version of example.mp4 with the default parameters.
```terminal
auto-editor example.mp4
```

You can change the **pace** of a video by changing by including frames that are silent but are next to loud parts. A frame margin of 8 will add up to 8 frames before and 8 frames after the loud part.

```terminal
auto-editor example.mp4 --frame_margin 8
```

There are many more features in auto-editor, including **adding in background music** that automatically gets quieter, and **zooming in** the video when it gets especially loud.

[See the docs](https://github.com/WyattBlue/auto-editor/blob/master/resources/docs.md) for more commands and usages.

## Installing Auto-Editor
 1. Download and Install the Latest Version of [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

```terminal
pip3 install auto-editor
```

The binaries you'll need are already installed, unless you're using Linux.
Linux users need to run this command. `sudo apt-get install libavformat-dev libavfilter-dev libavdevice-dev ffmpeg`

Now run it with the example video to make sure it is working.

```terminal
auto-editor example.mp4
```

If that works then congratulations, you have successfully installed auto-editor. You can use now use this with any other type of video or audio that you have.

```terminal
auto-editor C:path\to\your\video
```
