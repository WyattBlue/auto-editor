# Auto-Editor
Auto-Editor is a command line application program for automatically editing **video or audio**.
It works by analyzing the video's audio to detect when a section needs to be cut or kept in, then it runs a subprocess called ffmpeg to create the new video.

## New in 20w28a!
 * You can now use percentages for speeds.
 ```terminal
  $ python auto-editor.py --video_speed 200%
 ```
 * You can now use Hz or kHz when setting the sample rate.
 ```terminal
  $ python auto-editor.py --sample_rate 44.1 kHz
 ```
 * The help screen has been overhauled to be simpler and cleaner.
 * New dedicated script for handling audio files has been added.
 * Older versions of Python can now handle hours long audio files without crashing.
 * Auto-Editor won't crash anymore if your console does not support Unicode characters.

## Usage
### Minimal Example

Create an edited version of example.mp4 with the default parameters.
```terminal
 $ python auto-editor.py example.mp4
```

### Change the Feel
You can change the **pace** of a video by changing by including frames that are silent but are next to loud parts. A frame margin of 8 will add up to 8 frames before and 8 frames after the loud part.

```terminal
 $ python auto-editor.py example.mp4 --frame_margin 8
```

There are many more features in auto-editor, including **adding in background music** that automatically gets quieter, and **zooming in** the video when it gets especially loud.

[See the docs](/resources/docs.md) for more commands and usages.
