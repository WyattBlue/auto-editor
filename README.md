## Usage
Here's how to create an edited version of 'example.mp4' with the default parameters.
```
auto-editor example.mp4
```

You can change the **pace** of a video by changing by including frames that are silent but are next to loud parts. A frame margin of 8 will add up to 8 frames before and 8 frames after the loud part.

```
auto-editor example.mp4 --frame_margin 8
```
