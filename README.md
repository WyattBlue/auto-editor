# Auto-Editor
Auto-Editor is a command line application program for automatically editing video/audio into a entertaining and polished output.
It works by analyzing the video's audio to detect when a section needs to be cut, kept in, or zoomed in, then it runs a subprocess called ffmpeg to create the new video.

## New in 20w24a!
 * You can now use m4a audio files as an input type
 * You can now use videos with variable frame rates
 * Small output bug now fixed

# Usage
## Minimal Example

Create an edited version of example.mp4 with the default parameters.
```terminal
 $ python auto-editor.py example.mp4
```

## Change the Feel
You can change the pace of a video by changing by including frames that are silent but are next to loud parts. A frame margin of 8 will add up to 8 frames before and 8 frames after the loud part.

```terminal
 $ python auto-editor.py example.mp4 --frame_margin 8
```

There are many more features in auto-editor, including adding in background music that automatically gets quieter and zooming in the video when it gets especially loud.

[See the docs](/resources/docs.md) for more commands and usages.
