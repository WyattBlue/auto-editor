# 31.8.1

## Major
 -

## Features
 - Import Final Cut Pro XML: `.fcpxml` files and `.fcpxmld` bundles, with connected clips, transitions, speed, and volume. What a timeline can't hold, such as compound clips, is left out with a warning.

## Performance
 - A source that plays in two places at once, as across a dissolve or as a picture-in-picture or `loop` overlay of the same file, gets its own decoder for each instead of seeking back to a keyframe every frame. An edit with 1-second dissolves renders 2.5× faster, and a same-file overlay up to 40× faster.
 - Rendering no longer slows down quadratically with the number of clips: 160,000 one-frame clips render in 1.6 seconds instead of 58.
 - Importing FCP7 XML uses about 10% less memory.
 - `blackdetect` is 3.2× faster and `motion` 1.6× faster. Both now read a frame's true luma instead of a gray recomputed through RGB, so `motion` values run about 8% lower and `blackdetect` can shift a few frames at the end of a fade.

## Fixes
 - FCP7 XML import plays each audio track from the right stream of a multi-stream source, instead of the first stream for all of them, and keeps a mono source mono.
 - FCP7 XML import skips disabled clips, no longer turns Premiere's untouched opacity into an effect on every clip, and warns about the titles and nested sequences it leaves out. It is no longer experimental.
