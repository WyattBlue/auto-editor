## Performance
 - A source that plays in two places at once, as across a dissolve or as a picture-in-picture or `loop` overlay of the same file, gets its own decoder for each instead of seeking back to a keyframe every frame. An edit with 1-second dissolves renders 2.5× faster, and a same-file overlay up to 40× faster.
 - Rendering no longer slows down quadratically with the number of clips: 160,000 one-frame clips render in 1.6 seconds instead of 58.
 - Importing FCP7 XML uses about 10% less memory.
 - `blackdetect` is 3.2× faster and `motion` 1.6× faster. Both now read a frame's true luma instead of a gray recomputed through RGB, so `motion` values run about 8% lower and `blackdetect` can shift a few frames at the end of a fade.
