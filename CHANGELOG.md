 - Remove unused args, functions.

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/WyattBlue/auto-editor/compare/26.0.0...26.0.1


# 26.0.0

## Major
 - You can now preview videos before rendering is complete. (see footnote 1).
 - `unset` is now never a valid codec. Use `auto` instead.
 - `unset` is now not a valid bitrate value. Use `auto` instead.
 - Removed the `--extras` and `-qscale:v` cli options.
 - The `ae-ffmpeg` pypi package is deprecated and will be removed in a future release. Future versions of auto-editor will not ship ffmpeg cli binaries.
 - The `--my-ffmpeg` `--ffmpeg-location` `--show-ffmpeg-commands` and `--show-ffmpeg-debug` cli options are now deprecated and can be removed in a future `26.x` release.

## Features
 - Auto-Editor is consistency twice as fast as `25.x` if `-c:a pcm_s16le` is set.
 - Auto-Editor is now 20% faster to 50% slower with default options. (see footnotes 2 and 3).
 - Remove all uses of ffmpeg-cli in auto-editor, with the exception of a few holdouts (EBU norm, audio mixing, yt-dlp).
   * using GPL vs LGPL builds of PyAV now determine if the `libx264` or `libopen264` encoder is used.

## Fixes
 - Never write a "null frame" if the timeline is known to be linear. Fixes #468

## Footnotes
 - [1] You can preview media files if they are in the Matroska format (`.mkv`). Although `.mp4` hybrid could theoretically work, ffmpeg does not appear to have sufficient support yet. YMMV with other formats.
 - [2] Smaller files perform better. Larger files perform worse compared to `25.x` when using a solid state drive/fast storage.
 - [3] It should be possible to eventually recover this lost performance. Either with multiprocessing, or multi-threading with GIL-free builds of Python.

## Known Regressions
 - Data Streams, Attachment Streams, and Embedded Image (video) streams are now always dropped due to some limitations with the current version of PyAV. This should be fixed in a future version of `26.x`

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/WyattBlue/auto-editor/compare/25.3.1...26.0.0


# 25.3.1

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/WyattBlue/auto-editor/compare/25.1.0...25.2.0


# 25.1.0

## Features
 - Add the DaVinci Resolve FCP7 backend. It's not the default since there are known issues, but it is available if you're having other issues with the FCP11 backend.
 - Add `--config` flag option. When set, it will look for `./config.pal`. If found, it allows extending auto-editor by adding new editing methods by defining new procedures.

## Fixes
 - Fix "divide by zero error" when editing subtitle streams when a speed is exactly 0.
 - Removed the "speed" warning for the DaVinci Resolve FCP11 backend because it appears to not be true anymore for DaVinci Resolve 19 (maybe 18?) and newer.
 - Allow including/excluding the Palet standard environment for applications like pyinstaller.

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/WyattBlue/auto-editor/compare/23w20a...23w20b


# 23w20a

## What's Changed
- fcp7 backend (Premiere and DaVinci Resolve)
  - You can now export multiple video files into one xml
  - The xml now respects the number of channels the audio has and no longer assumes it's always 2
- v3 timeline backend

  - `"version"` value has been changed `"unstable:3.0"` -> `"3"`
  - the `"dur"` attribute for all timeline objects is now always the "real" duration even if the speed is != 1. This makes many internal operations simpler and imitates how fcp7 represents timing.
 - v1 timeline importing and exporting is back
 - All v(NUMBER) timelines now no longer use or accept semantic versioning

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/WyattBlue/auto-editor/compare/23w15a...23w20a

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/WyattBlue/auto-editor/compare/23w08a...23w10c


# 23w08a

## What's Changed
- `auto-editor info` now displays the audio stream's channel count
- `--add` now uses palet for parsing instead of having a little parsing language for each attribute.
```shell
#  old way, adding special characters like newline and tab was terrible
auto-editor --add 'text:0,60,This is my text!
Wow,font=Arial'

#  new clean and explicit way
auto-editor --add 'text:0,60,"This is my text!\nWow",font="Arial"'
```
- The palet scripting language, and its [associated docs](https://auto-editor.com/ref/23w08a/palet), has been greatly improved. For a normal auto-editor, palet doesn't matter right now, but allow for new and exciting auto-editor functionally in the future.

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/WyattBlue/auto-editor/compare/23w04a...23w08a


# 23w04a

## What's New

### New Features
 - Added `subtitle` edit method. `subtitle` analyzes subtitle streams and adds sections when any subtitle shown on screen matches the given regex pattern.
 - Added new attribute: `name` for the `premiere` and `final-cut-pro` export object.

### Breaking Changes
 - Removed `--min-clip` `--min-cut` cmd options. Use `minclip` and `mincut` procedures in the `--edit` option or the new `mincut` `minclip` attributes on the `audio` edit method: `--edit audio:mincut=4,minclip=3`
 - Removed `--show-ffmpeg-debug`. Instead use `--show-ffmpeg-commands` or `--show-ffmpeg-output`
 - Removed the `grep` subcommand. The new `subtitle` edit method does all of its functionality

### Palet
"Palet" is auto-editor's scripting language used in the `--edit` option and `repl` subcommand. It is similar to the racket language but has a few differences. Palet existed in earlier versions but it wasn't worth mentioning in the release notes until now.  The biggest change is that you can now define your own procedures:

```racket
(define circle-area (lambda (r) (* pi (* r r))))
(circle-area 5)
> 78.53981633974483

```


### Dependencies
 - Upgrade Pillow `9.3.0 -> 9.4.0`

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/WyattBlue/auto-editor/compare/22w52a...23w04a


# 22w52a

## What's New
- Fix capital file extensions confusing auto-editor

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/WyattBlue/auto-editor/compare/22w48a...22w52a


# 22w48a

### Bug Fixes
 - Fixed all of the subcommands not working when auto-editor is installed with pip
 - Make having the `readline` module optional for `repl`. This allows Windows to use it without immediately causing a traceback.

### Features
Auto-Editor can now read use its own v2 json timelines. v2 timelines are still undocumented and unstable[1] but is a step in the right direction and opens up the way for more powerful Premiere, ShotCut and FinalCutPro exports.

[1] In the sense that how it works can change from version to version.

### Breaking Changes
Exporting v1 json timelines has been removed due to in part to format being entirely undocumented. Auto-Editor still uses a v1-format like structure for "Editor" exports and

### What to Expect in the Future
Besides making 'Premiere and friends' exports better, Auto-Editor will not work on new features till at least mid-Jan, 2023. Instead improving documentation will be the primary focus.

## What's Changed
- ffmpeg colorspace won't be set if applied value is `reserved`
- Fixed premiere xml export setting `channelcount` to `10` instead of `2`
- Bug Fix: Handle PyAV reporting `stream.duration` as `None` instead of crashing #313

# 22w43a

## Changes
Add Python 3.11 support, drop Python 3.8 support
Improve Premiere Pro and ShotCut XML reading

## New Features
--edit now has direct access to the `margin` `mincut` `minclip` `cook` functions. Along with `or` `and` `xor` `not`

```
--edit '(or (margin 5 motion:4%) (cook 6 3 audio:threshold=4%))
```

## Bug Fixes
Fix `or` `and` `xor` length resizing. Old behavior added random data instead of just filling zeros.

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/WyattBlue/auto-editor/compare/22w39a...22w43a


# 22w39a

## Changes
 * Auto-Editor can now read Premiere xml files, provided that it follows a very strict subset of features
 * Timeline files now have `_ALTERED` part added
 * Premiere XML and ShotCut MLT timeline files have been improved

## Bug Fixes
 * Fixed bug on Windows that caused sound to not render right when speed was changed

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/WyattBlue/auto-editor/compare/22w37a...22w39a


# 22w37a

## New Features

You can now add audio to the timeline and change its volume.
```
auto-editor movie.mp4 \
--source my-background:/Users/wyattblue/Downloads/music.mp3 \
--add audio:0,500,my-background,volume=0.7
```

Auto-Editor renders volume using FFmpeg's [volume audio filter](https://www.ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg-filters.html#volume) and accepts both raw floats and decibels.

### dB units for audio threshold

dB is now a supported unit.

```
auto-editor --edit audio:threshold=-24dB  # equivalent to 0.063
```

## Minor Improvements
 * ZipSafe is now set to True, which makes auto-editor slightly faster
 * You can now add background music/audio


## Breaking Changes
 * Removed `--timeline` and `--api` options. Instead, use the export option as so: `--export timeline:api=$VAL`

## Bug Fixes
* Final Cut Pro: Use numerator and denominator of timebase fraction by @marcelohenrique in https://github.com/WyattBlue/auto-editor/pull/302

## New Contributors
* @marcelohenrique made their first contribution in https://github.com/WyattBlue/auto-editor/pull/302
