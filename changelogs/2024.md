# 25.2.0

## Features
 - Use PyAV 13
 - Add stacktraces to the Palet Programming Language
 - Add `input-port?` type and more procedures. Helpful for writing custom edit procedures in `config.pal`.

## Fixes

 - Set upper bounds on dependencies

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/WyattBlue/auto-editor/compare/25.1.0...25.2.0


# 25.1.0

## Features
 - Add the DaVinci Resolve FCP7 backend. It's not the default since there are known issues, but it is available if you're having other issues with the FCP11 backend.
 - Add `--config` flag option. When set, it will look for `./config.pal`. If found, it allows extending auto-editor by adding new editing methods by defining new procedures.

## Fixes
 - Fix "divide by zero error" when editing subtitle streams when a speed is exactly 0.
 - Removed the "speed" warning for the DaVinci Resolve FCP11 backend because it appears to not be true anymore for DaVinci Resolve 19 (maybe 18?) and newer.
 - Allow including/excluding the Palet standard environment for applications like pyinstaller.

# 25.0.0

## Major

## Fixes
 - Step around PyAV bug when getting pix_fmt. Fixes #489
 - Add `hevc_nevc` as a known encoder. Fixes #490
 - The cache is twice as small as the equivalent 24w31a would write.
