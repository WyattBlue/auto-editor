# Code of Conduct

In the interest of furthering the goals of this project and creating a welcoming and professional space, we have written these rules and guidelines to guide and reassure others of our standards.

 * Do not threaten, defraud, doxx, or scam anyone.
 * Do not make personal attacks against other people.
 * Do not call [violence](https://www.oed.com/oed2/00277885#:~:text=1.,c1290%20Beket%20932%20in%20S.) against any individual or group.
 * Do not make sweeping generalizations about groups defined by mostly uncontrollable physical or mental attributes.
 * Always follow the platform's Acceptable Use Policies and Terms of Service. (e.g. Github's [Acceptable Use Policy](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/site-policy/github-acceptable-use-policies))


## Enforcement

These rules are to be applied and enforced equally, regardless of the offending or victims: maintainer status, seniority, societal status, or physical attributes.

Content that violates these standards may be removed at the maintainers discretion. Content that comes close to violating these standards may be warned. Multiple warnings may lead to removal to content warned about. Persons who repeatedly break the rules may be banned or excluded.

If the maintainers constantly break there own rules, or selectively enforce the rules to a great extend, the maintainers must lower their own standards, and let others do what they can get away with, or revise the rules to a more fair and equal standing.

## Scope

This code of conduct applies to this GitHub repository and any official platforms linked.

The code of conduct does not apply to private conversations between persons or in real life unless the person represents this project in an official capacity.
